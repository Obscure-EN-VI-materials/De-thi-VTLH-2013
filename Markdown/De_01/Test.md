**Read the following passage and mark the letter A, B, C, or D on your answer sheet to indicate the correct answer to each of the questions.**

*Martin Symington went on a camping safari holiday with his wife and three*

*teenagers.*

We stood silently under the stars, just meters from our tent, hardly daring to breathe. Adam, one of the camp staff, swept a torch beam across a clearing where four impala stood, panicky on their nimble legs. Could they sense the danger they were in? Did they know, as we did, that a female leopard lay under a thorn bush?

She sprang. Four shadowy shapes bounced into the woods. Had the leopard made a successful kill? We all had our theories, but in truth the whole scene had taken place too quickly, and in insufficient light, for any of us to be sure. Now we understood why we had been warned not to go out of our tent after dark, except when accompanied by a staff member. In fact, we had been on our way from the tent to the supper-time camp-fire when Adam's torch had unexpectedly caught the leopard's glinting green eyes. Half an hour later we had a tale to outdo most told around the fire. "This has got to be the best nightlife in the world,' replied Toby, when some middle-aged fellow safari enthusiast asked him how he was enjoying his holiday.

So much for the assortment of self-appointed experts who doubted that safaris and teenagers would be a workable mix. True, this is a difficult age, with adolescents beginning to sense that they are too old for family holidays. But nor did ours want to return to beach resorts with the kind of 'teen clubs' they wouldn't be seen dead in. So, my wife Hennie and I reckoned, if we were going to have one really good family holiday, why not Africa?

Our holiday began with a flight to Arusha airport, then a long drive to West Kilimanjaro Camp - a semi-permanent gathering of explorer-style tents near the base of the great volcano which was to tease us with rare glimpses of her snowy summit which is 5,895 meters high.

We were introduced to Emmanuel Kinayet, our guide who led us on daily bush walks. Our children wanted to ask Emmanuel a thousand questions about himself and his life, but soon realized that was the wrong approach. Rather, his story seeped out by degrees as he escorted us through his homeland, stopping at places such as a muddy waterhole and a herders' settlement of huts.

Next we took to the hot African sky in a small plane and headed south. Unlike in West Kilimanjaro, there is no human population in the Ruaha other than a lodge for the park rangers, and four small safari camps. We chose to stay at Mdonya Old River Camp, because this is one that avoids luxuries such as soft beds and fluffy towels; these, to my mind, can become obstacles to connecting with nature in the raw. Instead, the five of us shared a simple, yet adequate, tent at the edge of a dried-up sand river.

If there was one disappointment about the wildlife viewing in Tanzania, it was that game drives are not permitted in any of the country's national parks after dusk. But if anything, this made our night-time meeting with the leopard and impala outside our tent even more special, bringing home to us the rewards of staying at camps where there are no fences, distractions or even electricity.

By day we mixed game drives with walks through the bush under the protection of our guide Esau for the time we spent in Ruaha. He taught us about bush safety: stay attentive and at a distance from the wildlife, and always stand still if you see an animal approaching you. We spotted only plant-eating animals - elephant, zebra and a pair of giraffes but we all listened carefully to his repeated message to 'remember that you will see less than one per cent of what sees you'.

Our final hop was over to Zanzibar where we sailed out to a sandbank, swam through bright yellow and pink-and-blue fish and watched a crimson sun set. And we concluded that if there is one family holiday that will have undying teen appeal, it is a safari.

65\. How did the family feel when they were sitting round the camp-fire?

A. interested in the stories of the other campers.

B. proud of what they had seen earlier.

C. sorry they had disturbed the leopard.

D. annoyed they didn't know what happened in the end.

66\. Why did the writer and his wife decide to choose a safari holiday in Africa?

A. They didn't want to be with other families.

B. They wanted their children to learn some independence.

C. They wanted to do something different from usual.

D. They were advised that teenagers often enjoy safaris.

A. They were hardly ever able to see the top of it.

B. They would have preferred to camp higher up it.

C. They were surprised at how cold it must be at the top.

D. They realized how difficult it would be to climb to the top.

A. He answered their questions but said no more.

B. He didn't tell them everything about himself all at once.

**Read the following passage and mark the letter A, B, C, or D on your answer sheet to indicate the correct answer to each of the questions.**

They call Jamaica the 'Island in the Sun', and that is my memory of it. Of sunshine, warmth and abundant fruit growing everywhere, and of love. I was born on 2 April 1960 in St Andrews in Kingston. There were two sisters ahead of me in the family, and though of course I didn't know it, there was excited talk of emigration, possibly to Canada but more usually to England, the land of opportunity. I guess that plans were already being made when I was born, for a year or so later my Dad left for London. Two years after that, when he had saved enough money, my Mum went as well and my sisters and I were left in the care of my grandmother. I stayed with her, in her house near the centre of Kingston, until I was seven years old. My grandmother, therefore, shaped my life, and I believe I am all the better for it.

Grandmothers are often strict, but they usually also spoil you. At least, that is the way it was with mine. She ran the family like a military operation: each of us, no matter how young, had our tasks. I remember that we didn't have a tap in the house, but used a communal tap from which we had to fill two barrels in our garden. Every morning, before we went to school, we all had to take a bucket appropriate to our size and run a relay from the communal tap to the barrels until they were full. In the beginning, when I was two or three, I couldn't reach the barrel but I still had to join in. My sisters had to sweep the yard before they went to school. My grandmother would give orders to the eldest and these were passed down as I got older I found **this** particularly annoying! But I can tell you, no one avoided their duties.

This was all fairly normal. Emigrating to better yourself was a dream for most Jamaicans, a dream many were determined to fulfill. Families were close and grandmothers were an important part of family life so, when the mass emigration began, it seemed perfectly right and natural for them to take over the running of the families left behind. After all, they had the experience. Grandmothers are often strict, but they usually also spoil you. At least, that is the way it was with mine. She ran the family like a military operation: each of us, no matter how young, had our tasks.

My Dad came over from England to see how we were getting on. I hadn't known him when he had left for Britain, but when I saw him I somehow knew that he was my father. He talked to us about the new country, about snow, about the huge city, and we all wanted to know more, to see what it was like. He also told me that I now had a younger brother, which made me feel excited and wonder what he could be like. I didn't know it at the time, but he had come to prepare us for the move to England. Six months later my grandmother told me that I was going to join my parents and that she, too, was emigrating. It was the end of my time in the Caribbean, of the sheltered, warm, family life that I had known there, and the beginning of a new and exciting era.

London was strange and disappointing. There was no gold on the pavements, as the stories in Jamaica had indicated. Back home it had always been warm. Everyone was friendly and said 'Hello' when you passed by on the street; in Kingston you knew everybody and they knew you. Here, it wasn't like that. The roads were busy, the buildings were grey and dull, with many tall, high-rise blocks. It was totally unlike Jamaica, the houses all small and packed close together. In my grandmother's house I had a big bedroom; here I had to share. At that age it was a great disappointment.

Worse was to come, because there followed a very cold winter, and I had never felt cold in my life before. Then came the biggest shock: snow. White flakes came out of the sky and Dad smiled, pointed and said, 'That's snow!' I rushed outside, looked up and opened my mouth to let the flakes drop in. The snow settled on my tongue and it was so cold that I cried. My toes lost all feeling, and at the primary school that we attended I wasn't allowed to wear long trousers at my age. The teachers made us go out to play in the playground and I joined in with all the fun, sliding around in the snow,throwing snowballs, all the usual things. Suddenly, as my shoes and socks got soaking wet and frozen, there came a terrible pain and I cried with the intensity of it. I didn't know what was happening to me.
